      <h1>Tamil Nadu</h1>
      <p>
        Tamil Naduis the
        southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and
        the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil
        people, whose Tamil language—one of the longest surviving classical
        languages in the world—is widely spoken in the state and serves as its
        official language. The capital and largest city is Chennai. Located on
        the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is defined
        by the lush Western Ghats and the semi-arid Deccan Plateau in the west,
        the discontinuous Eastern Ghats in the north, the fertile Eastern
        Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar
        and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern
        cape of the peninsula—Kanyakumari, and the river Kaveri bisecting the
        state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala,
        Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry, as
        well as an international maritime border with the Northern Province of
        Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.
